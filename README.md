# VPN of Life!
Small repo full of useful scripts and do-dads, that save my ass.

Biggest and most important one being `web.sh`, which does a bunch of complicated pain in the ass shite (that took me a whole day to properly get working), just to opening a browser using a VPN... instead of running the VPN on the whole system... which was a PITA... don't judge me mkay?
